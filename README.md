### **Featured Publication**

**A Novel 2-Qubit Quantum Random Number Generator Discovered Through Evolutionary Optimization**
*   **Status:** Published on viXra, July 2025
*   **Identifier:** viXra:2507.0048
*   **Abstract:** This paper presents a novel methodology for the automated discovery of a quantum circuit for random number generation using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting circuit was used to generate a 1MB data stream which successfully passed the full `dieharder` statistical test suite.
